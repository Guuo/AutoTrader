# AutoTrader
A personal project created to automate backtesting trading strategies. Current implementation requires hardcoded strategies and market symbols, as there has not yet been a need to create a proper UX at this level of development, considering it is a personal project. Supports a number of different indicators with full OHLC candlestick data, many different time intervals, and allows market data to be requested from a live source and saved to disk as .csv files. Backtesting can be done on data requested live or on CSV data previously saved to disk. Also supports live monitoring and Windows-based alerts according to any strategy.

An unfinished project and currently not under active development.
